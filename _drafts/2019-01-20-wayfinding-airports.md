title: The Wayfinding Mission of Getting to NYC Airports from Manhattan
---

I've lived in Manhattan for about 9 months and this topic seems to be one of the more polarizing as I talk about how I transport myself to visit my family in Virginia. Some people reluctantly fly to visit family because they have no choice (non-East Coasters and international) but give themselves hours of time to offset the unpredictablility of the route. Others just feel uncomfortable with the trek out to Newark, LaGuardia, and Kennedy airports and stick to buses and trains as a means of transport. Don't get me wrong, flying isn't always the cheapest alternative or the most pleasant experience, but I do enjoy the feeling of coming back to Earth after being at 10,000 feet for a while.

I found myself at work in Union Square contemplating the 6 ways that Citymapper shows me I can get to an airport, but I was overloaded with fear of not understanding how travelling on commuter rail (or an express bus) works. I'm hoping these routes inspire confidence in wayfinding yourself to a New York City airport.

### EWR (Newark Liberty International Airport)

#### Primary Route
Use a MetroCard to pay $2.75 for a one-way ride to Penn Station via the 1/2/3. While at Penn Station (eastern side, closer to the 34th Street and 7th Avenue 1/2/3 subway station), find a NJ Transit ticket machine and purchase a ticket to Newark Airport which should cost $13.00. This ticket includes the $5.00 AirTrain cost, so be sure to keep your ticket! Board _any_ train that has an airplane icon (✈︎) on the departure board (typically towards either Long Branch or Trenton). Once on board the NJ Transit train, a conductor will come by and inspect your ticket and hand it back to you. When you arrive at the airport train station, you will walk to the entrance of the AirTrain station and scan your ticket's barcode at a fare gate. Board the AirTrain and head to the terminal of your choice (A, B, or C).

Duration: 60-70 minutes

#### Alternate Route #1
You find yourself in Lower Manhattan and see there is _red everywhere_ on the map for traffic to cross into New Jersey.
Use a MetroCard to pay $2.75 for a one-way ride to _Newark Penn Station_ via the PATH. Make sure the train you board is heading to Journal Square (from World Trade Center this is not a problem). Transfer at Journal Square or Grove Street if you are coming from 14th/33rd Street. Head towards Newark Penn Station. At Newark Penn Station, find a NJ Transit ticket machine and purchase a ticket to Newark Airport which should cost $8.50. This ticket includes the $5.00 AirTrain cost, so be sure to keep your ticket! Board _any_ train that has an airplane icon (✈︎) on the departure board. Once on board the NJ Transit train, a conductor will come by and inspect your ticket and hand it back to you. When you arrive at the airport train station, you will walk to the entrance of the AirTrain station and scan your ticket's barcode at a fare gate. Board the AirTrain and head to the terminal of your choice (A, B, or C).

#### Alternate Route #2
You find yourself in Lower Manhattan and see there is _red everywhere_ on the map for traffic to cross into New Jersey.
Use a MetroCard to pay $2.75 for a one-way ride to _Newark Penn Station_ via the PATH. Make sure the train you board is heading to Journal Square (from World Trade Center this is not a problem). Transfer at Journal Square if you are coming from 14th/33rd Street. Head towards Newark Penn Station. At Newark Penn Station, you can decide to take a cab/Uber/Lyft/Via/etc. which would cost around $10. One can also take a bus from Newark Penn Station to the airport (Route 62).

Duration: 60-90 minutes depending on traffic

#### Alternate Route #3
You find yourself in Midtown Manhattan and you don't feel like braving the crowds.
Make your way to 42nd Street-Port Authority Bus Terminal and catch the Newark Airport Express bus. Ticket costs $18.00 for a one-way ticket ($31.00 round-trip) and it is a direct ride to the terminal of your choice (A, B, or C). The bus runs every 20 minutes during peak hours and 30 minutes during off-peak hours.

Duration: 40-90 minutes depending on traffic
