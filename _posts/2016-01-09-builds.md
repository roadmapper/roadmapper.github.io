The Road to Automated Builds

Early in March 2015 I transitioned to another project within my office. I was extremely excited about starting Android application development. At the same time I joined the team, the next release was in the process of being designed. The tech leads decided to transition to using the full Atlassian suite of tools from (JIRA, Bamboo Confluence, etc.). As somone who was eager to be fully agile, it was difficult to witness the lack of agile processes used by the team at that point.

I began to ask questions about process and software design and it became clear how little design was done on current software due to the "lack of time".

Two kinds of people help me form my decisions on how to get the team moving into a higher performing team.
1) The hard-working mid-level dev
2) The cynical mid-level tester/dev
