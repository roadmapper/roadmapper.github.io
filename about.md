## About
Since a young age I've been a curious person interested in _anything_ that is interactive. I'm always keen to design and implement solutions for interesting problems.

I'm currently a software engineer working on trust products at Brex, an corporate and card expense management product; these days I dabble in wherever the business needs me in securing our internal/external APIs and connecting the dots across engineering and product domains.
We mostly use Kotlin today, but I dabble in some Golang (and reluctantly Elixir) from time to time.

In my career, I've worked on:
- The bank account opening platform at Capital One (account eligibility, identity verification, single sign-on setup)
- Designed and developed a cloud based analytical and algorithmic processing engine with Kubernetes for various government agencies
- Developed a variety of cellular based applications for various government agencies
  - Mobile base station coordinator software for cellular radios
  - Android applications to submit/recieve field multimedia data
- Built backend systems (Java, Rails, C#) and done small/medium amounts of work with frontend (AngularJS)

My alma mater is the University of Virginia (SEAS '14) where I worked on interesting projects like a data dashboard for Local Energy Alliance Program in Charlottesville and a sensor network to detect occupancy in study spaces in Rice Hall (the Computer Science) building. As an undergraduate student, I was a part of Engineering Student Council's executive board and an Engineering School Guide (you know those awkward students that walk you around ~~campus~~ Grounds).

While I'm not churning code, I'm a trivia junkie (always hungry for more knowledge), aviation enthusiast, an amateur photographer (Fujifilm X-T3) and an avid baker (white chocolate raspberry cheesecake anyone?).
