## About
Since a young age I've been a curious cat interested in anything that is interactive. I'm always ready to design and implement solutions for interesting problems!

I'm currently a software engineer working on product security at Brex. In the past, I've worked on the bank account opening platform at Capital One, developed a cloud based analytical and algorithmic processing engine, applications for Android, built backend systems (Java, Rails, C#) and done small/medium amounts of work with frontend (AngularJS). My alma mater is the University of Virginia (SEAS '14) where I worked on interesting projects like a data dashboard for Local Energy Alliance Program in Charlottesville and a sensor network to detect occupancy in study spaces in Rice Hall (the Computer Science) building. As an undergraduate student, I was a part of Engineering Student Council's executive board and an Engineering School Guide (you know those awkward students that walk you around ~~campus~~ Grounds).

While I'm not churning code, I'm a trivia junkie (always hungry for more knowledge), aviation enthusiast and an avid baker (white chocolate raspberry cheesecake anyone?).
